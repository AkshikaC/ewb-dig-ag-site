# Dig Ag React App

To build the app:

```
npm run build
```

And then, to deploy:

```
firebase deploy
```

## Libraries In Use

As of now, we use a few libraries to make development easier.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) is used to deploy the application to our domain name https://ewb-dig-ag.org.

[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/) provides us with some basic components to maintain consistent style.
